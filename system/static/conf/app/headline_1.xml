		Minutes the RSS feed caches are considered valid for all feeds
		Making this too short can get the system to be banned for accessing the feeds too often from remote servers
		Recommended value is 30 minutes
		Note that RSS won't be fetched exactly the every minute specified here
		but will have a few random minutes margin to randomize each feed fetch process not to try to fetch many RSS on the same minute

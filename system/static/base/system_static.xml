		[Description]

		The system wide configuration file.
		Each entries should not be commented out but kept as blank (value="") if unnecessary.

		Entries are written in single level XML to ease the parsing without the need for XML libraries.

		On occasions that the root directory on http server is not set to 'system/static/root/' but the top directory of the package on the server (which is a bad idea),
		make really sure that this file does not get displayed by client request.

		TODO - Might want to cache the configuration values for each languages instead of parsing this every request (Parameter to define such file goes to?)
	-->

	<!-- DOM root node name
		The identification name for root DOM node within the browser JavaScript environment
		Make sure to keep it with only alphabets to be safe technically

	<!-- System Database
		Where to store the system database. db_user_type can be any of database type implmented in 'LANG/connection.EXT' file under configuration directory.
		For example, 'mysql', 'pgsql' and 'sqlite'.
		To specify unix socket connection, specify the socket as the db_user_host and db_user_port will be ignored in this case.
		For sqlite, db_user_host, db_user_port, db_user_user and db_user_pass are ignored and db_user_database is used as the file name.

	<!-- User Database
		Where to store the user database. Can be the same as the system database.
		A string of '%APP%' will be replaced as the name of the application accessing the database
		and '%VERSION%' for the version of the application's database (not the version of the application itself).
		And for db_user_database, '%USER%' will also be replaced as the logged in user's name.

		Not recommended to use string substitution for anything but sqlite, since it will unlikely to be able to create a new database on the fly.
		FIXME - It doesn't even try to create a new database right now.
		TODO - Might implement dynamic database creation in case var substitution was specified for db name for db like mysql (but depends on db server permission)
		TODO - Make db_user_database possible to be specified as a relative path to system root folder only for sqlite

	<!-- System Version

	-->
	<conf name="system_version" value="1_0_0"/>

	<!-- Automatic User Creation
		Whether to create user accounts automatically or not upon first successful authentication
		through external authentication mechanism. (ex : ldap)
		The value can be either 1 or 0 and if this is set to 0, user accounts must be manually added to 'system_static_user'
		table in the system database before an user can gain the access even if the authentication succeeds.
		Has no meaning when 'system_auth' is set to "local" since it refers to the same database for both user list and authentication.
	-->
	<conf name="user_create" value="1"/>

	<!-- Database Hash Algorithm

		  Disable when debugging under caching disabled.
	-->
	<conf name="minify" value="1"/>

	<!-- Compression
		Compression flag for any compress operations.
		Only turn off for debugging purpose as it will usually have bad impact on performance when off.
		Do NOT turn on or off while the system is in use, as it can try to decompress plain text
		thinking it was supposed to have been compressed or vice versa not decompressing a compressed string
		Clear the caches first, if it needs to be flipped.
	-->
	<conf name="compress" value="1"/>

	<!-- File system umask value

		Numbers are, 2:Critical, 3:Error, 4:Warning, 5:Notice, 6:Info, 7:Debug
		(Ommitting 0 and 1 for 'Emergency' and 'Fatal' level mirrored against syslog levels as they are not really useful for the system.)
	-->
	<conf name="log_system" value="2"/>

	<!-- User side log level
		Verbosity level to log to the user's database. Value meanings are same as above.
		Should not be too high to inflate the users' database size.
	-->

	<!-- Log display level
		Verbosity level to display the errors on screen. Value meanings are same as above.
	-->
	<conf name="log_display" value="2"/>

	<!-- Log SQL query parameters
		Whether to display SQL query or not in the log.
		SQL queries are not logged by any of the above settings.
		Setting it to 1 will display the query with placeholders.
		Setting it to 2 will fill in the actual values. (Watch out for binary and long text values in the queries.)
		The setting can be changed dynamically in the codes.
	-->
	<conf name="log_query" value="0"/>

	<!-- Detailed system log report level
		Level of system logging to start displaying detailed debug message to display.
		Only useful when the log is configured to be displayed on screen.
		Not applicable for user logging.
		Note that this can display alot of information to the screen under higher levels.

	-->
	<conf name="periodic_level" value="2"/>

	<!-- Periodic log mail

	<!-- Demo mode
		Turn the system into demo mode "1" or not "0".
		Demo mode forbids any POST request to avoid writing data and allows multiple clients to use a single user.
		Turn on for the purpose of demonstrating the system.
		A guest user should be first created with demo mode off, tweak its user setting and turn on demo mode to disallow any changes.
		It is typically easier to use 'system_auth' as 'demo' for a simple authentication.
	-->
	<conf name="demo" value="0"/>

	<!-- Extension settings

	<!-- Commonly Subscribed Applications
		List of applications those will be given to a new user.
		Note that if an application's dependent application is not available for an user it can cause errors on client side.
		Check each application's document for required dependencies. Dependencies can also vary from version to version on a same application as well.

		Any applications listed in 'public' configuration will be available to an user without mentioning them here.
		Which also means when 'public' configuration is empty, this setting has no meaning.

		The application will be set subscribed on the first login of the user.

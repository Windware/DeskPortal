	<!-- Key string to encrypt user password in their databases
		Since this application needs the passwords to access the mail servers in plain text form,
		the passwords will be stored in a readable format, but it will be encrypted with the key string mentioned here
		but will be decrypted using this key upon usage.

		Anyone accessing the user database will not be able to decrypt the user password without this key string.
		While both the database and the key string may be accessed from the same source together,
		it is still better to keep the password in an encrypted form than in plain text.

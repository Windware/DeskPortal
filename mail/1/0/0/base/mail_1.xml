	<!-- Key string to encrypt user password in database
		Since this application needs the passwords to access the mail servers in plain text form,
		the passwords will be stored in a readable format, but it will be encrypted with the key string mentioned here
		and will be decrypted using this key upon use.

		Anyone accessing the user database will not be able to decrypt the user password without this key string.
		While both the database and the key string may be accessed from the same source together,
		it is still encrypted to be better than kept as plain text.

		Changing this value during use will render all request to remote mail servers invalid.

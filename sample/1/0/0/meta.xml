	<!-- Information on the application
		'revision'
		In case a critical problem is found on a version, it will be overwritten with this number increased.
		Typically, when a problem is found, the last digit of the version number is increased when a fix is issued
		instead of overwriting the already published version to avoid breaking other codes those rely on it.
		Increasing this number is the last resort when a specific version is broken enough that it cannot be left as is.

		'category'
		Specify which category this application belongs to.
		Category lists are found in 'system/*/*/*/document/categories.xml'
	-->
	<info revision="1" category="system" />

	<!-- Applicable country
		In case the application only makes sense in specific countries, (ex : postal code lookup of a specific country)
		note about the name of countries in here in 2 letter abbreviated form. (Do not confuse with language abbreviations.)
		Make multiple entries if appropriate. If it has no country limitations, omit this tag.
		If the application only supports specific languages, do not limit the application by country names but use 'language' tags explained next.
	-->
	<country name="jp" />

	<!-- List of supported languages
		Languages the application is translated to. Embed 'translator' tags inside to denote translator names.
		Optionally give 'site' attributes for 'translator' tags.
	-->
	<language name="en">
		<translator name="Windware Solution" contact="no_reply@windware-solution.com" />
	</language>

	<language name="ja">
		<translator name="Windware Solution" contact="no_reply@windware-solution.com" />
	</language>

	<!-- Name the contributors here. 'site' is optional. -->
	<contributor name="Windware Solution" contact="no_reply@windware-solution.com" site="http://windware-solution.com/" />

	<!--
		Place any requirements to run those are not mentioned in the system's 'meta.xml'.
		1 requirement per <item> node described in short English sentence.
		Skip this section altogether if nothing to note of.
	-->
	<requirement>
		<item></item>
	</requirement>

	<!--
		List the licenses for this application.
		The more specific statements will override licenses declared broader.
		Make sure if any other different licenses are used, they do not conflict with other licenses used, including other applications.
		In <folder> node, 'name' with '.' means the top directory of this application version. (ex : sample/1/0/0/)
		And it goes downwards for more specific statements.
		The folders must be stated hierarchically one by one to reach the files and folders with different licenses.
		<folder> and <file> may have any number of <author> nodes inside to specify the authors.
		If a 'license' attribute is applied to a <folder>, it will mean every items inside that folder are licensed as such
		but a <file> node inside will override the license for that specific file.
		If multiple licenses are applied on a folder or a file, put multiple 'license' attributes.
		'site' and 'note' (to note about anything) attributes are optional. Others are required unless such information is missing.
		A wildcard character can be used to match any letters. (ex : <file name="*.jpg">)
